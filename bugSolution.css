Several workarounds are possible depending on the desired layout behavior. One solution is to avoid using `calc()` with percentages and viewport units together, opting for alternative layout techniques such as flexbox or grid, or using JavaScript to calculate the dimensions.  Another method involves explicitly specifying the calculation in pixels or ems. For example, consider changing `width: calc(50% - 10vw);` to `width: 50%; margin-left: 10vw;` or using JS to calculate and set the width dynamically.
